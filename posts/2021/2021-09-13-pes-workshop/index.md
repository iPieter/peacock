In 2020, we, a group of researchers working within European Computer Science departments on AI-ethics and adjacent fields with diverse disciplinary background organized a workshop on the use of algorithmic tools in public employment services (PES). During this workshop—and in the subsequent paper, we tried to answer the following research question:

- What are factors that are decisive for finding a job?
- What are the roles of job counselors?
- What are the challenges of automating interactions between job counselors and job seekers?
- What are important blind spots in existing conversations around PES?
- What could a data-driven system for PES look like in an ideal world?

# The workshop
We organized this workshop around the topic of algorithmic and data-driven tools in PES. Our aim was to bring together people with very different perspectives and disciplinary backgrounds. Our work addresses the significant potential of algorithms to be beneficial to society, while also acknowledging the risks of applying technology-driven solutions to complex, long-standing societal issues.

The workshop took place online in May 2020. It comprised three keynote talks, a panel, and audience participation and discussion.More info on the speakers and format can be found [here](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt/PES/). In total,  37 participants were present, consisting of researchers, system developers, public servants, civic organizations’ representatives from diverse academic disciplines, non-governmental organizations, industry, and the public sector. 

# Lessons learned
1. We argue for the use of co-design workshops in the design process, especially focussing on people who's voices are often not heard. This can be challenging, particularly with language differences. However, precisely because these challenges will also emerge when systems are deployed, we argue that co-design should be a central aspect of PES systems. 
2. We argue that data-driven systems should be used as advisors instead of decision makers.
3. We argue to involve all stakeholders in the design of PES systems.
4. We argue that counsellors should be able to contest system outputs and be trained to do so, naturally without any negative incentives.
5. Given these lessons, we question if some tools need to be created at all.

# Conclusion
We organized a workshop to discuss the implementation of data-driven tools in PES and the risk that they embed real-world beliefs, which we summarized in a set of recommendations where all stakeholders are included (especially job seekers) and where contestation and refusal paths are first-class design objectives.
